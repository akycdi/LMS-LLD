# Library Management System - Low-Level Design Problem

This project involves designing and implementing a Library Management System in Java. The system aims to assist librarians in efficiently managing books, patrons, and lending processes. The solution demonstrates the application of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), adherence to SOLID principles, and the use of relevant design patterns.

## Features

### Book Management
- **Book Class**: Represents a book with attributes such as title, author, ISBN, and publication year.
- **Inventory Operations**:
    - Add, remove, and update books in the library inventory.
    - Search for books by title, author, or ISBN.

### Patron Management
- **Patron Class**: Represents library members with relevant details.
- **Patron Operations**:
    - Add new patrons and update their information.
    - Track borrowing history for each patron.

### Lending Process
- **Checkout and Return**:
    - Implement book checkout functionality.
    - Manage book returns and update inventory accordingly.

### Inventory Management
- **Availability Tracking**:
    - Maintain records of available and borrowed books.

## Design Principles
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: The system is designed using OOP concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
- **SOLID Principles**: Ensures scalability, maintainability, and flexibility of the system.
- **Design Patterns**: Incorporates appropriate design patterns to solve common problems effectively.
